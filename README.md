# FridayFilm


# In the Queries folder, there will be a file called 'SeedData.sql', run the queries in SQL server.
# The test data is mostly focused on the 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' movie as creating the data was a long process. (The API didn't have all the info I wanted)

# Preliminary Downloads
# Version of .NET 6.0+
# VSCode
# SQL Server


# Open the 'FridayFilm' folder in VSCode
# Click Terminal to open a powershell

# Ensure you have these packages installed (type in terminal without #):
# dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation
# dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
# dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore

# Type 'dotnet watch' to start the program (it may take some time to build)
