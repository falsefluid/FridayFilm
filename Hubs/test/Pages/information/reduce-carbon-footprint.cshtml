        <h2>Carbon Footprint</h2>
        <h3>What is a carbon footprint?</h3>
        <p>
            A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane)
            that are generated by our actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This can be caused by everyday activities, such as driving, using your phone, and even eating habits.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the average footprint for someone in the UK, it is 12.7 tonnes of COâ‚‚e per year.

        <h3>Why is it bad?</h3>
        <p>
            Carbon dioxide levels are rising at an astronomical rate, which is causing global warming and climate change.
            These rising average temperatures could cause:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ice caps to melt and oceans to warm, causing sea levels to rise.</li>
            <li>Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy downpours, and wildfires.</li>
            <li>Changes to where different wildlife populations can live and survive.</li>
            <li>Disrupted access to food.</li>
            <li>Increased spreading of diseases such as malaria.</li>
        </ul>
